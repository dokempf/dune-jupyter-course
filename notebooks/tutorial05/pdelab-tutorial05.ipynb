    " - The constant $C$ in the estimate is usually not known exactly, and this should be taken into account when defining the tolerance $\\text{TOL}$.\n",
    " - The error estimate may converge with a lower order than the actual discretization error which yields a very pessimistic stopping criterion. If the error estimate converges with the same order, then the estimator is called *efficient*. The lowest applicable constant $C$ is then the *efficiency index*.\n",

    "All of these considerations only hold if the PDE is linear. If the function $q(u)$ is nonlinear, then the estimate $\\gamma(u_h)$ is no longer guaranteed to be an upper bound for the discretization error $\\|u-u_h\\|_{1,\\Omega}$. However, it may still be used as an error indicator that is used to refine a given mesh. This can produce misleading results, and therefore the conclusions drawn from the estimate should be rather conservative. The error estimate will become more reliable the closer the finite element solution $u_h$ is to the exact solution $u$, as long as the function $q(u)$ is regular enough to be linearized around the exact solution."

    "*Disclaimer: In this exercise we compute and evalute the $L_2$-norm of the error. The residual based error estimator implemented in the code, however, estimates the $H^1$-seminorm (which is equivalent to the $H^1$-norm here) and thus also optimizes the mesh with respect to that norm.  This is done to make the exercise as simple as possible. It would be more appropriate to carry out the experiments either with the true $H^1$-norm or to change the estimator to the $L_2$-norm.*\n",

This can be done by creating a grid function with the squared error using    `Dune::PDELab::SqrGridFunctionAdapter` from    `<dune/pdelab/function/sqr.hh>` and the function `Dune::PDELab::integrateGridFunction` contained in the header file   `<dune/pdelab/common/functionutilities.hh>`. Output the result to the console by writing in a single line a tag like `L2ERROR`, the number of degrees of freedom using `gfs.globalSize()` and the $L_2$-norm.
